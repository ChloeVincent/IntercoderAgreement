The intercoder agreement test allows the team to test whether the coders of the team code the comments in a comparable manner. 

The script requires a csv file corresponding to the "Coded segments" sheet of the exported excel file from the MAXQDA project in which copies of the same document are coded by each coder of the team.

It ouputs a report that provides the intercoder agreement of every possible pair of coders as well the list of comments the test is based one with the respective codings.
